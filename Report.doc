Introduction:
The purpose of this project is to create a job scheduler/dsipatcher that automatically assigns job to the largest server type. This job scheduler needs to be compatiable with
the supplied ds-server file (from https://github.com/distsys-MQ/ds-sim). The scheduler should fucntion in a similar manned to the ds-client file provided within the supplied file.
All simulation logs (provided via the "-v brief" function) should exactly mathc those produced by the original ds-client file.
